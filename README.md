# CMMI_4_SpiraTeam_Integration
This is a Process template for TFS 2017 that is compatible with SpiraTeam integration
All the Microsoft Test processes have been removed.  Instead this template serves to separate Developers from Testers by TFS permissions.  Testers do their work on SpiraTeam mostly and Developers do all their work with TFS.  More details later.  If there are any questions, please create an issue.
